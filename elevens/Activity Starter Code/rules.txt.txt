The solitaire game of Elevens uses a deck of 52 cards, with ranks A (ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (jack),

Q (queen), and K (king), and suits ? (clubs), ? (diamonds), ? (hearts), and ? (spades). Here is how it

is played.

1. The deck is shuffled, and nine cards are dealt “face up” from the deck to the board.

2. Then the following sequence of steps is repeated:

a. The player removes each pair of cards (A, 2, ... , 10) that total 11, e.g., an 8 and a 3, or a 10

and an A. An ace is worth 1, and suits are ignored when determining cards to remove.

b. Any triplet consisting of a J, a Q, and a K is also removed by the player. Suits are also ignored

when determining which cards to remove.

c. Cards are dealt from the deck if possible to replace the cards just removed.
